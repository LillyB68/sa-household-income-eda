# Understanding Household Income and Living Conditions in South Africa (IES 2023)

## Project Overview
This project explores household-level data from Statistics South Africa’s **Income and Expenditure Survey (IES) 2023**. The goal is to clean, explore, and analyze real-world survey data to better understand household income distribution, living conditions, and access to basic services in South Africa.

The project is designed as a **foundational data science project**, focusing on developing strong data handling skills, making defensible data cleaning decisions, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and communicating insights clearly and responsibly.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to:
- Clean and prepare real-world household survey data
- Understand the distribution of household income and expenditure
- Explore relationships between income, household characteristics, and access to services
- Practice structured exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Communicate findings clearly using visualizations and written explanations

---

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **household-level fact table** from Statistics South Africa’s **Income and Expenditure Survey (IES) 2023**.

The dataset contains information on:
- Household income and expenditure
- Household size and composition
- Geographic indicators (e.g. province)
- Access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation
- Coded categorical variables typical of large national surveys

As with most real-world survey data, the dataset includes:
- Missing values
- Numerically coded categorical responses
- Skewed income distributions
- Data quality challenges that require careful handling and documentation

## Methodology
The project follows a structured data science workflow:

1. **Data Inspection**
   - Understand the structure, variables, and size of the dataset
   - Identify missing values, unusual distributions, and potential data quality issues

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values thoughtfully
   - Convert variables to appropriate data types
   - Document all cleaning decisions and assumptions
   - Preserve the integrity of the original dataset

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyze income and expenditure distributions
   - Explore relationships between income, household size, education, and access to services
   - Identify patterns, disparities, and trends across provinces and household groups

4. **Interpretation and Communication**
   - Translate numerical results into meaningful insights
   - Use visualizations to support findings
   - Clearly explain limitations and areas for future work

## Status
🚧 **Project in progress**

This project is part of a structured data science learning path. Future extensions may include feature engineering and predictive modeling based on the cleaned dataset.

## Notes
This project prioritizes **clarity, reasoning, and transparency** over complexity. The focus is on demonstrating strong data fundamentals, sound analytical thinking, and the ability to work with realistic, imperfect data — skills that are essential for entry-level data science and analytics roles.
